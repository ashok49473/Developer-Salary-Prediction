# Developer Salary Prediction
### Project:
- This is a machine learning-based solution to predict the salary of a software developer based on various factors such as years of experience, location, and education.
- The main advantage of this project is that it can save time and resources for both employers and job seekers in determining a fair salary range. Additionally, the project can help identify trends and disparities in developer salaries, allowing for more informed decision making in the job market.
-  The use of machine learning also enables more accurate salary predictions compared to traditional methods.

Here is a web application to predict the salary of a developer based on his/her experience, country and other features.<br>
